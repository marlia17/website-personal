					<h1>Work Experience</h1>
					Working as a junior sales consultant at the Al Ikhsan Bukit Bintang temporary store amid the Movement Control Order presented an enlightening experience. Despite the hurdles brought about by the pandemic, it served as a chance to swiftly adjust to ever-changing situations. Interacting with customers passionate about sports and fitness during this phase was gratifying; it felt like contributing to their quest to stay active and motivated amidst uncertain times. This role instilled in me resilience and adaptability while managing reduced footfall and continuously evolving safety measures. Collaborating with an energetic team amplified the experience, nurturing a strong bond and a collective drive to deliver exceptional service despite the challenging circumstances. Overall, it proved to be a period of growth, learning, and honing my customer service skills and adaptability in unforeseen scenarios.
